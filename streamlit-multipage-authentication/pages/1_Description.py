The numerous methods are applied for achieving stock price prediction. Here, we will be considering the majority of those algorithms, which are broadly divided into the following categories:
- **Traditional Machine Learning Methods:** Includes traditional methods such as:
  - Linear regression
  - Logistic regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
  - Gaussian Naïve Bayes
  - Random forest
- **Time Series Analysis Methods:** These methods include:
  - Simple Moving Average (SMA) with different weights
  - Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)
  - Prophet
- **Deep Learning and Neural Networks:** Many of these techniques make use of RNNs and some of which are the special types of RNN:
  - Simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
  - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
  - Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
  - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) (with various combination of Hyperparameters)
  - Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) (with various combination of Hyperparameters)
  - Hybrid LSTM (For example: CNN-LSTM & CNN-Bi-LSTM)
  - Dense layer Forecast (For a control model)

These following algorithms will be tested, analyzed, and reviewed on a same dataset of time-series stock data. By comparing the Root Mean Square Errors (RMSE), the best algorithm will be determined for the final prediction model.

# After comparing Traditional Machine Learning Methods, Strictly Time Series Analysis Methods, 
# and Deep Learning and Neural Networks, we have come to a conclusion that for this dataset, 
# LSTM is the best model so far in these three broad categories of Algorithms. 

# By further comparing the variants of LSTM, BiLSTM & Hybrid LSTMs in a trial-and-error manner, 
# we tried to find the most accurate combination of layers which will give the best results 
# and the least amount of error. The difference in the errors in the best models of LSTM, BiLSTM 
# & Hybrid LSTM are really negligible, but the hybrid LSTM performed better than the other final models.

# **Best Model:**
# The results in various research papers show that additional training of data in BiLSTM-based modeling 
# or the hybrid LSTM offers better predictions than regular LSTM-based models or the ARIMA models.
# But in this case, the Hybrid CNN-LSTM model with dropout regularization performed the best, even better 
# than the BiLSTM variant of this particular hybrid model, which is quite surprising.
